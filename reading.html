<p>summer school 2020: paper discussion</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[Qiang Hou] <b>gas giant planet formation</b><br />
five stages of planet formation<br />
(1) solid accretion -&gt; gas accretion (smooth) -&gt; gas accretion (runaway) -&gt; gap opens -&gt; evolution (cooling track)<br />
(2) three concepts: (a) Hill radius (planet's gravitation against star's gravitation). (b) Bondi radius (planet's gravitation against molecular thermal motion). (c) gap-open condition (angular momentum transport timescale ~ diffusion timescale)<br />
(3) method: four 1D spherically symmetric equations of planetary evolution, at each time-step an amount of mass needs to be added</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Xuan Ji] <b>secular resonance</b><br />
(1) perturbation (due to disk or other planets) -&gt; orbital precession -&gt; when the precession rates of two planets are close, secular resonance occurs -&gt; angular momentum ~ sqrt(a*(1-e^2)) transfers from small planet to large planet -&gt; eccentricity e of small planet increases -&gt; ejection and collisions of small planets<br />
(2) three concepts: (a) energy ~ -1/a depends only on semi-major axis but angular momentum depends on both semi-major axis and eccentricity. (b) 6 orbital parameters (2 for orbital shape, 3 for orbital position, 1 for planet position). (c) perturbation equation.<br />
(3) method: rebound code to solve N body dynamics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Jiachen Zheng] <b>accretion disk</b><br />
What causes accretion and how to model accretion?<br />
(1) disk can become unstable due to magnetic field (or nonlinear hydrodynamic process) to generate turbulence and accretion -&gt; turbulent Reynolds stress enhances disk diffusion and angular momentum transport -&gt; turbulent Reynolds stress is modelled by turbulent viscosity to describe the effect of turbulence on disk diffusion and angular momentum transport -&gt; then how to model turbulent viscosity, nu ~ alpha*c_s*H ~ alpha*c_s^2/Omega where alpha is a dimensionless parameter.<br />
(2) three concepts: (a) surface density evolution satisfies diffusion equation (b) perturbation equations of orbit motion, radial oscillation frequency (i.e. epicyclic frequency) and vertical oscillation frequency, radial resonance (Lindblad resonance) and vertical resonance. (c) to study the disk people use a simplified model of shearing box (Cartesian box replaces cylindrical geometry).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Yuru Xu] <b>planetary magnetic fields</b><br />
Magnetic fields of astronomical bodies are generated by dynamo action.<br />
(1) simplify MHD equations -&gt; balance between power of thermal convection and Ohmic dissipation, plus velocity estimated by mixing length theory -&gt; scaling law of magnetic energy, B^2 ~ (density)^1/3 * (heat flux)^2/3, independent of rotation<br />
(2) This scaling law fits well with observations of planets in solar system (except Neptune), and it fits ok with numerical simulations.<br />
大家以后多熟悉这种基于物理对方程简化，从而推出标度率的方法，可以避免大型的数值计算。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Qiang Hou] <b>initial condition of planetary evolution</b> and <b>tidal heating to explain large radius of exoplanets</b>.<br />
(1) shock in planetary formation runaway process -&gt; initial entropy, temperature, and luminosity are low (called cold start) -&gt; different evolutionary tracks from hot start (planet with a larger mass has a better memory in terms of different initial conditions)<br />
(2) tidal heating leads to larger radius of exoplanets -&gt; numerical calculation of planetary evolution is consistent with the estimation of orbital evolution based on tidal Q ~ 10^5<br />
(3) some concepts: a. Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling timescale = GM^2/(RL), b. tidal Q number, c. tidal effects on orbit: circularization and synchronization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Xuan Ji] <b>Bayesian analysis of exoplanet inflation</b><br />
(1) planetary radius depends on incident flux -&gt; energy source = e*F, where F is incident flux and e is a coefficient -&gt; use Bayesian analysis to test various distributions for the coefficient e(F) (together with mass, age, metal fraction, etc.) -&gt; the best distribution of e(F) is Gaussian and the mean F corresponds to equilibrium temperature around 1500 K -&gt; Ohmic dissipation model fits well with this distribution of e(F), i.e. Ohmic dissipation is non-monotonic and has a peak at around 1500 K but other models do not have this feature.<br />
(2) the key concept: observational constraints</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Qiang Hou] <b>blue shift of Lyman alpha due to charge exchange in planetary atmosphere to estimate stellar wind speed and the upper limit of planetary magnetic fields</b><br />
(1) in addition to thermal motion, some non-thermal effects, i.e. radiation pressure, charge exchange between hot H+ in stellar wind and cold H in planetary atmosphere, etc., also induce doppler shift -&gt; charge exchange occurs in the blue wing (stellar wind points to the Earth during eclipse) -&gt; compare between the blue shift of absorbtion line of Lyman alpha and the model involving the macro- and micro-physics to determine the stellar wind speed 400 km/s -&gt; estimate the upper limit of planetary magnetic fields and dipole moment around 10% that of Jupiter<br />
(2) concepts: a. spectral line broadening, b. thermal and non-thermal Doppler shift, c. charge exchange between H+ and H, d. electron and photo induced ionization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>[Xing Wei] <b>summary for the above 7 talks</b><br />
(1) 读文章先形成 big picture，数学细节以后可以再填上去，不要畏惧数学方程，熟悉了之后，就只是工具。<br />
(2) 行星科学很新，读文章尤其是比较新的文章时，打个问号。<br />
(3) 行星科学包括很多内容，行星形成、结构、演化、轨道、大气、内部、磁场、吸积盘，有理论、有各个波段的观测、有数值计算，等等，大家努力成为行星科学整个领域的专家。</p>
